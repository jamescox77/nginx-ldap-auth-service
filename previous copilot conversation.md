```python

First, add the [`secret_key`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fcoxj%2FOneDrive%20-%20FUJITSU%2FDocuments%2FCode%2FUOB%2Fnginx-ldap-auth-service%2Fnginx_ldap_auth%2Fsettings.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A39%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%7D%5D%2C%22812db3f6-bf58-4366-b84f-17d426bdfa4e%22%5D "Go to definition") field to the [`Settings`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fcoxj%2FOneDrive%20-%20FUJITSU%2FDocuments%2FCode%2FUOB%2Fnginx-ldap-auth-service%2Fnginx_ldap_auth%2Fsettings.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A9%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fcoxj%2FOneDrive%20-%20FUJITSU%2FDocuments%2FCode%2FUOB%2Fnginx-ldap-auth-service%2Fdoc%2Fsource%2Fapi%2Fsettings.rst%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A2%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%7D%5D%2C%22812db3f6-bf58-4366-b84f-17d426bdfa4e%22%5D "Go to definition") class:

```python

Next, ensure that the [`SECRET_KEY`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fcoxj%2FOneDrive%20-%20FUJITSU%2FDocuments%2FCode%2FUOB%2Fnginx-ldap-auth-service%2Fetc%2Fenvironment.txt%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%7D%5D%2C%22812db3f6-bf58-4366-b84f-17d426bdfa4e%22%5D "Go to definition") environment variable is set in your environment configuration. You can add it to your etc/environment.txt file:

```txt

Make sure to replace `your_secret_key_here` with an actual secret key value. This should resolve the [`ValidationError`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fcoxj%2FOneDrive%20-%20FUJITSU%2FDocuments%2FCode%2FUOB%2Fnginx-ldap-auth-service%2Fnginx_ldap_auth%2Fsettings.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A1%2C%22character%22%3A21%7D%7D%5D%2C%22812db3f6-bf58-4366-b84f-17d426bdfa4e%22%5D "Go to definition") for the missing [`secret_key`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fcoxj%2FOneDrive%20-%20FUJITSU%2FDocuments%2FCode%2FUOB%2Fnginx-ldap-auth-service%2Fnginx_ldap_auth%2Fsettings.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A39%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%7D%5D%2C%22812db3f6-bf58-4366-b84f-17d426bdfa4e%22%5D "Go to definition") field.

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **@classmethod**: This decorator indicates that [`parse_ldap`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FC%3A%2FUsers%2Fcoxj%2FOneDrive%20-%20FUJITSU%2FDocuments%2FCode%2FUOB%2Fnginx-ldap-auth-service%2Fnginx_ldap_auth%2Fapp%2Fmodels.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A264%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%7D%5D%2C%22850af597-56d1-47c5-a94d-801bd456db9d%22%5D "Go to definition") is a class method, meaning it receives the class ([`cls`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FC%3A%2FUsers%2Fcoxj%2FOneDrive%20-%20FUJITSU%2FDocuments%2FCode%2FUOB%2Fnginx-ldap-auth-service%2Fnginx_ldap_auth%2Fapp%2Fmodels.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A264%2C%22character%22%3A19%7D%7D%5D%2C%22850af597-56d1-47c5-a94d-801bd456db9d%22%5D "Go to definition")) as its first argument instead of an instance of the class.

2. **def parse_ldap(cls, data: LDAPObject) -> "User"**: This defines the method [`parse_ldap`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FC%3A%2FUsers%2Fcoxj%2FOneDrive%20-%20FUJITSU%2FDocuments%2FCode%2FUOB%2Fnginx-ldap-auth-service%2Fnginx_ldap_auth%2Fapp%2Fmodels.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A264%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%7D%5D%2C%22850af597-56d1-47c5-a94d-801bd456db9d%22%5D "Go to definition") which takes two arguments:
   - [`cls`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FC%3A%2FUsers%2Fcoxj%2FOneDrive%20-%20FUJITSU%2FDocuments%2FCode%2FUOB%2Fnginx-ldap-auth-service%2Fnginx_ldap_auth%2Fapp%2Fmodels.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A264%2C%22character%22%3A19%7D%7D%5D%2C%22850af597-56d1-47c5-a94d-801bd456db9d%22%5D "Go to definition"): The class itself.

3. **kwargs = { 'uid': data['uid'][0], 'full_name': data['cn'][0] }**: This creates a dictionary [`kwargs`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FC%3A%2FUsers%2Fcoxj%2FOneDrive%20-%20FUJITSU%2FDocuments%2FCode%2FUOB%2Fnginx-ldap-auth-service%2Fnginx_ldap_auth%2Fapp%2Fmodels.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A265%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%7D%5D%2C%22850af597-56d1-47c5-a94d-801bd456db9d%22%5D "Go to definition") with two key-value pairs:

jamescox77: I want to add additional logging to log out the user object with all it's ldap object first, and then the user object

GitHub Copilot: To add additional logging to log the LDAP object and the created User object, you can use the `logging` module. Here's how you can modify the [`parse_ldap`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FC%3A%2FUsers%2Fcoxj%2FOneDrive%20-%20FUJITSU%2FDocuments%2FCode%2FUOB%2Fnginx-ldap-auth-service%2Fnginx_ldap_auth%2Fapp%2Fmodels.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A264%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%7D%5D%2C%2220ed8798-c37d-4f5d-92cc-4bce5de3e9c3%22%5D "Go to definition") method to include logging:

1. Import the `logging` module.
2. Configure the logging settings.
3. Add logging statements to log the LDAP object and the created User object.

Here's the updated code:

```python
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class User(BaseModel):
    # Assuming other fields and methods are defined here

    @classmethod
    def parse_ldap(cls, data: LDAPObject) -> "User":
        # Log the LDAP object
        logger.info(f"LDAP object: {data}")

        kwargs = {
            'uid': data['uid'][0],
            'full_name': data['cn'][0],
        }

        # Create the User object
        user = cls(**kwargs)

        # Log the created User object
        logger.info(f"Created User object: {user}")

        return user
```

This code will log the LDAP object and the created User object at the INFO level. Make sure to replace `BaseModel` with the appropriate base class and ensure that the [`User`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FC%3A%2FUsers%2Fcoxj%2FOneDrive%20-%20FUJITSU%2FDocuments%2FCode%2FUOB%2Fnginx-ldap-auth-service%2Fnginx_ldap_auth%2Fapp%2Fmodels.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A264%2C%22character%22%3A46%7D%7D%5D%2C%2220ed8798-c37d-4f5d-92cc-4bce5de3e9c3%22%5D "Go to definition") class is properly defined.

jamescox77: getting code unreacheable for this bit         # Log the created User object
        logger.info(f"Created User object: {user}")

GitHub Copilot: To ensure the logging statements are reachable and the code executes correctly, you need to make sure the logging configuration is set up properly and the logging statements are placed correctly. Here is the updated code with proper logging:

```python
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class User(BaseModel):
    # Assuming other fields and methods are defined here

    @classmethod

Make sure to replace `BaseModel` with the appropriate base class and ensure that the [`User`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FC%3A%2FUsers%2Fcoxj%2FOneDrive%20-%20FUJITSU%2FDocuments%2FCode%2FUOB%2Fnginx-ldap-auth-service%2Fnginx_ldap_auth%2Fapp%2Fmodels.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A264%2C%22character%22%3A46%7D%7D%5D%2C%22dd0d4d3b-29e2-4898-bbf7-ebefd6b1cf9f%22%5D "Go to definition") class is properly defined. This code will log the LDAP object and the created User object at the INFO level.

jamescox77: @workspace so changing this ('uid': data['sAMAccountName'][0],) from using uid to using sAMAccountName is not working because the service things it's using a uid even though it's the value of sAMAccountName. uid does not exest in the user object so we are getting this.
